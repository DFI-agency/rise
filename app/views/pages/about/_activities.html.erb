          <h4 class="">
            Community‚Äêbased organizations, educational institutions, and other entities have launched hundreds of initiatives across the U.S. focused on boys and men of color.
            Foundations have invested considerably in these  initiatives, research studies, and  evaluation projects.
            Despite this, life experiences and outcomes among boys and men of color remain largely unchanged; in some instances, they have worsened over time.

          <h4>In response to these problems and opportunities, RISE has six main activity categories:</h4>

At each convening, boys and men of color, families, community stakeholders, policymakers, and practitioners will help scholars identify urgent, culturally responsive research and evaluation needs. Scholars will be convened within and across the five fields.</h3>

                  Maintaining a vibrant virtual community that unites evaluators and researchers across the five fields with each other and promotes learning and action by policymakers, community agents, and practitioners. This dynamic web portal will include an extensive, open-access library of research on boys and men of color, a national directory of experts on each ethnic group and in each field, occasional virtual community engagement forums, and numerous other resources.
