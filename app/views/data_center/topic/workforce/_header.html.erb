               <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Description of the Data</h4>
               <p>
                 The estimated percentage of employment status for men 16 years old and over,
                 disaggregated by race and ethnicity subgroups. Responses are classified as those who
                 are in labor force which include in Armed Forces and Civilian as employed or
                 unemployed.
               </h4>

               <p>
                 Employed includes all civilians 16 years old and over who either a) were at work or b) were
                 with a job but not at work. Excluded from the employed are people whose only activity consisted
                 of work around the house or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations.
                 Also excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the United States Armed
                 Forces. Unemployed includes all civilians 16 years old and over who either a) were neither “at work”
                 nor “with a job but not at work,” b) were actively looking for work during the last 4 weeks, and/or c)
                 were available to start a job.
               </p>

               <p>
                 Military includes civilian labor force plus members of the U.S. Armed Forces (people on active duty
                 with the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard)
               </p>

               <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Data Source</h4>
               <p class="">
                 Data was retrieved from Table B23001 of the 2006-2010 American Community Survey available for
                 download on the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">American FactFinder Website</a>.
               </p>

               <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Notes</h4>
               <p class="">
                 <strong class="type--fade">Limitations of data:</strong> The data may understate the number of employed people because people who have
                 irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The number of
                 employed people “at work” is probably overstated in the data (and conversely, the number of employed
                 “with a job, but not at work” is understated) since some people on vacation or sick leave erroneously
                 reported themselves as working. This problem has no effect on the total number of employed people.
               </p>
