           The RISE Grad Prep Academy is a project that prepares scholars for doctoral study and research-related careers
           in the five RISE fields: education, health, human services and social policy, juvenile and
           criminal justice, and workforce development.

        <h2 class="color--orange">This program includes a four-day visit to the University of Southern California. We will select
       32 juniors and cover all their travel expenses, lodging, and meals.</h2>
        <h4>
           During their visit to our campus in November 2016, the selected scholars will learn more about
           applying to and succeeding in graduate school; meet our faculty and hear about their research
           projects; interact with our graduate students and alumni; and tour Los Angeles.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          We will also pay for Academy participants to take a four-week Kaplan course valued at $1,200
          to prepare for the Graduate Record Exam (the GRE is required for admission to most graduate
          programs). Additionally, each Academy participant will be paired with a current male Ph.D.
          student of color who will offer mentoring throughout the graduate school application process,
          feedback on essays and other application materials, and advice on where to apply and
          ultimately enroll.
        </h4>
        <h5 class="no-margin type--bold">Important Note:</h4>
        <h4>
          Academy participation in no way guarantees eventual admission to the University of Southern
          California. If not at USC, our larger aim is for all 32 scholars to enroll in highly selective
          graduate programs at top research universities in Fall 2018, immediately upon completion of
          their bachelor’s degrees.
