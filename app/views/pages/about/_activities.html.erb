            Community‚Äêbased organizations, educational institutions, and other entities have launched hundreds of initiatives across the U.S. focused on boys and men of color.
            Foundations have invested considerably in these  initiatives, research studies, and  evaluation projects.
            Despite this, life experiences and outcomes among boys and men of color remain largely unchanged; in some instances, they have worsened over time.

          <h4>RISE responds to these problems and opportunities with six main activities:</h4>

At each convening, boys and men of color, families, community stakeholders, policymakers, and practitioners will help scholars identify urgent, culturally responsive research and evaluation needs. Scholars will be convened within and across the five fields.</h3>
