            <h4 class="">
              Racial/ethnic minority youth and youth diagnosed with mental illness are more likely to come into contact with the police and subsequently be involved in the juvenile justice system. As one would expect from the statistics, youth of color who are also diagnosed with a mental illness experience a form of “double jeopardy” when it comes to risk for incarceration.

              Given the high burden of violence on boys and men of color, it should be a priority to understand the factors contributing to violence exposure and involvement, and evaluate programs that might reduce this burden. As described in more detail below, strengths-based approaches hold particular promise for alleviating the burden of violence. It is the purpose of this paper to review existing knowledge on strengths-based approaches for boys and men of color.

              Inequities in social determinants of health—the many dimensions that contribute to overall quality of life including education, criminal justice, economic opportunity, and workforce development—are a major driver of health inequities. Among these, educational attainment (or lack thereof) has consistently been demonstrated to have one of the strongest associations with long-term health and quality of life outcomes.

              Underutilization of healthcare minimizes opportunities for early detection and preventive interventions that could improve chronic disease and mental health outcomes in boys and men of color (BMOC). To be certain, healthcare underutilization among BMOC is not purely a consequence of limited insurance or access, but rather it is driven by broader social determinants (e.g., education, housing, transportation, neighborhood conditions, and income).

            <h4 class="">
              Developing culturally relevant human services for racial and ethnic minorities has become a national priority. However, understanding what works, how it works, and why it works within certain cultural-specific communities continues to be severely limited, despite efforts of professional fields to promote multicultural practice. This limitation is only intensified when looking at the subpopulation of boys and men within communities of Color. One way to fill this gap is to utilize a cultural-specific framework to guide the scan of various sources of knowledge (e.g., academic literature and community-led products).

              By many indicators and social markers, a large majority of Indigenous boys and men are struggling. But, as some are fond of saying, the devil is in the details. The available data tell a grim story about the past and present, but the “real story” of how American Indian boys and men are faring in the world is not fully told. Without discounting statistics, our fundamental point is that anyone interested in this work needs to have more systematic, structural data to get the full, complex, nuanced picture of what is happening.

            <h4 class="">
              Communities with limited economic opportunity tend to have higher rates of incarceration. Involvement in the criminal justice system decreases the likelihood of graduating from high school and gaining employment, and increases the chances of future involvement in the criminal justice system. It is a dismal cycle.
