                    <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Description of the Data</h4>
                    <p>
                      The estimated percentage of educational attainment for men 18 years old and over, disaggregated by race and
                      ethnicity subgroups. Responses are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of
                      school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report
                      the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Attainment data is the proportion of male respondents reporting their highest degree received as a function of the total male population for that age group and race/ethnicity subgroup.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      College pushout data is the proportion of male respondents reporting some post-secondary training with no degree received as a function of the total male population for that age group and race/ethnicity subgroup.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Data Source</h4>
                    <p class="">
                      Data was retrieved from Table B15001 of the 2006-2010 American Community Survey available for download on the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">American FactFinder Website</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-bold no-margin">Notes</h4>
                    <p class="">
                      Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) is included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.
                    </p>

                    <p>Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng.</p>

                    <p>The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.</p>

                    <p>The instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.</p>

                    <p>For more information on the description of the data and comparability with earlier versions of the survey, see the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2010_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">ACS 2010 Subject Definitions documentation</a>.</p>
