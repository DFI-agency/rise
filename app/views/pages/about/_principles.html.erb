          <h3>RISE Principles</h3>
          <p>Ten principles were used to construct a RISE theory of change and develop its strategic activities. These principles respond to longstanding needs, challenges, and opportunities in academic research, community-based and youth-serving organizations, government and policymaking venues, and media.</p>

                 </li>
                <li><h5>Interdisciplinarity </h5> Understanding the interconnectedness of systems and conditions that work together to support and cyclically disadvantage boys and men of color; recognizing, for example, that inequities in education and health are inextricably linked.</li>
                <li><h5>Intersectionality</h5> Recognizing how race intersects with socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, language, (dis)ability, religion, and a range of identities that boys and men of color possess and perform.</li>

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li><h5>Structural, Systemic, and Policy Change</h5> Working to dismantle systems of oppression and institutionalized racism by strategically using research on boys and men of color to inform policymaking and philanthropy.</li>
